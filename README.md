# TaxonWorks Together 2020

Agenda, notes, planning, etc. for TaxonWorks Together 2020.  Questions?  Chat now! [![Gitter][3]][2] or open an issue here.

# What
Yes, it's last second, but it's 2020, so nothing should surprise you by this point!  _TaxonWorks Together_ is a week (Nov. 31-Dec. 4th) of events focused on building up the [TaxonWorks](http://taxonworks.org) community.  In this first year we'll focus on technical aspects of the software, but there are also lots of opportunities to ask questions, meet others and learn about TaxonWorks. These activities are open events (to the extent technically possible), your feedback and contributions will make a difference. Some activities will be highly guided, some information style, and some unconference style.   

# Who
Taxonomists, curators, collection managers, software developers, biodiversity information scientists. If you have questions about TaxonWorks this is the week to ask them.  Familiarity at some level with TaxonWorks will help during some events, but it’s not required.

# How
1) Get a Github account (not required, but recommended), an account will help you better participate in many aspects of the community.
2) [Register and select events of interest](https://forms.gle/U5bKh8WC5zJb4tGQ8).  You'll be emailed Zoom link(s) prior/during the events.
3) If you want to hack TaxonWorks itself, start reading [install_taxonworks](https://github.com/SpeciesFileGroup/install_taxonworks/blob/master/development/README.md) and plan on attending one or both of the pre-meeting help sessions. 
4) [Post ideas, requests, questions to be tackled during the week](https://github.com/SpeciesFileGroup/taxonworks_together_2020/issues)

# Events

_All events are pending until `Event status` reads `Confirmed`.  All events will have time at the beginning, end end (and pending type throughout) for questions and answers._

## Pre meeting setup
* Event status: Pending
* Who: Community members who want to effect change in the codebase itself, or run a local version of TaxonWorks for any reason.
* When: Tuesday Nov. 24th 9:30 - 11:30 AM CST.  
* Where: Zoom link via email via [form](1).
* What: Get help with setting up a TaxonWorks development environment. There will only be one other help opportunity officially setup to help in this way, we *very highly* recommend you attend this to work out the kinks (and, frankly, have us polish the tricky bits).  _After TaxonWorks Together starts we will not be able to help at this level._
* Requirements: A Linux (e.g. Ubuntu) or Mac operating system or virtual environment that supports either. Super keen?  Follow instructions here: https://github.com/SpeciesFileGroup/install_taxonworks.

## Last chance setup
* Event status: Pending
* When: Monday Nov. 30, 10:00 - 11:30 AM CST
* Where: Zoom link via email via [form](1).
* What: The last chance to get your development environment setup.  Don’t wait till now!  See ‘Pre meeting setup’ 

## Hello World!
* Event status: Pending
* When: Monday Nov. 30, 1:30 - 3:30 PM CST
* Where: Zoom link via email via [form](1).
* What: A very basic guided exercise illustrating the simplest path forward to creating a new Task in TaxonWorks. The intent is to turn on the system and create "Hello World" in a TaxonWorks task card, nothing much more. We'll also talk about how we'll share code, and maybe have a little Git tutorial to set the stage for other activities later in the week.
* Requirements: A working development environment (if you want to follow along, highly recommended), or your curiosity.

## Intro to digitization
* Event status: Pending
* Who: Everyone
* When: Tuesday Dec. 1, 9:00 - 10:00 AM CST
* Where: Zoom link via email via [form](1).
* What: A quick overview of natural history collection digitization features and workflows available in TaxonWorks led by INHS Insect Collection curator Tommy McElrath.
* Requirements: None.

## Your data, everywhere
* Event status: Pending
* When: Tuesday. Dec. 1. 10:15 - 11:30 AM CST
* Where: Zoom link via email via [form](1).
* What: Your data curated in TaxonWorks, out there there in the World. After a lightning fast introduction (e.g. [Matt's TDWG poster](https://static.tdwg.org/conferences/2020/posters/ps_59170_yoder.pdf)) help to find, develop and briefly document as many ways possible to integrate the TaxonWorks [API]() in to other software (e.g. Open Refine, Excel), languages (e.g. R, Ruby, Python), and ecosystems (e.g. Bash shell scripting). We'll have a couple of real-life examples, but this session is up to all of us to figure out how to extend the use of the API.
* Requirements: Desire to access your data via the API so that you can "do stuff" with it. Your expertise in integrating web-based API calls is needed!
* HINT: if you’re not sure what an API is, come and lurk to learn about different ways to access your data, and how to get it in just the format you need.

# TaxonWorks end-to-end
* Event status: Pending
* When: Tuesday. Dec. 1. 1:30 - 4:00 PM CST
* Where: Zoom link via email via [form](1).
* What: A quick, and somewhat technical overview of the TaxonWorks stack in action with reference to four aspects: 1) the Rails console (exposing TaxonWorks models/environment via an interactive console); 2) API development (how to stub new routes/endpoints); 3) Scripting via Rake tasks (e.g. import, desktop access to code); and 4) unit-testing. Recommended for people with intermediate to advanced technical questions, and for those who want a glimpse of what they could do with their data offline in a development environment.  Includes background for those looking to build out products derived from their data (e.g. visualizations, information pages).
* Requirements: A TaxonWorks development environment if you wish to play along.  Your technical questions.

## Open office day
* Event status: Pending

* Where: Zoom link via email via [form](1).
* What: Unconference (really, not a conference, and no planning for the day either). We'll be hanging out on line, all day, to answer your questions, give small tutorials, etc. First come first serve. We'll try and have break out rooms for those of you working on your own project.
* Requirements: Your motivation.

## Intro to nomenclature
* Event status: Pending
* When: Wednesday Dec. 2. 11:00 - 12:00 PM CST
* Where: Zoom link via email via [form](1).

Moderated by Debbie Paul. Special guest David Shorthouse from the [Bionomia](https://bionomia.net/) website. There's lots of things we could do, including integration/coding challenges, demos of tools and use of the TaxonWorks people-related code base, etc., but this session is open and truely unconference style.
* Requirements: None.

## Intro to matrices and observations
* Event status: Pending
* When: Thursday Dec. 3 1:00-2:00 PM CST

* Event status: Pending
* When: Thursday. Dec. 3. 2:15-4:15 PM CST
* Where: Zoom link via email via [form](1).

* What: Come to work with Matt & José, challenge them with a new feature request, and watch them live code the idea into a perfectly polished, flawless, ready for production feature (well, maybe not that last bit, but you get the idea). If you're curious about the interplay between the backend (JSON serving) and frontend (Vue.js) this is the opportunity to get a glimpse of those interactions.  You'll also gain some understanding of the TaxonWorks models/concepts and their use in an interactive interface.
* Requirements: None.
